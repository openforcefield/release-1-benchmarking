This directory contains the results of, and the files necessary to reproduce the benchmarking OpenFF parsley and
a handful of popular force fields against a data set of condensed phase liquid properties.

This directory is split into three key subdirectories:

- The ``curation`` directory contains the scripts used to curate the data set to benchmark against.
- The ``estimation`` directory contains the scripts used to estimate the data sets using the different force fields
- The ``analysis`` directory containts the scripts used to analyse the estimated physical property data sets.
